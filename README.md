# OOSC-hackathon-Trumio
## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a Web3-based solution that provides a universal, immutable, and easily accessible identifier for students and professionals, authenticated and verified via a blockchain-based Decentralized Identity (DID) System. This system leverages MetaMask for secure account management and interaction with the Ethereum blockchain.

### Objective

Implement a blockchain-based Decentralized Identity (DID) System to ensure each user has a unique, tamper-proof digital identity that enhances security, privacy, and interoperability.

## Features

- **MetaMask Integration**: Users can manage their identities using MetaMask, a secure Ethereum wallet.
- **Unique Digital Identity**: Secure and immutable identities on the blockchain.

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Wallet**: MetaMask

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
